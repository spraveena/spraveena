### What I do
Hello there. My interest primarily lies understanding how our brain perceives and processes music, the use of computational techniques to understand this process, and in the development of potential applications of music cognition. My current research revolves around using Machine Learning on EEG signals to understand how timbre is encoded and processed in our brains.<br><br>

I am also interested in potential uses of music cognition in both motor and cognitive rehabilitation


My publications can be found [here](publications.md)








### Research Background

I am currently a doctoral candidate at [CAANLab](https://caanlab.ca) in Memorial University of Newfoundland working on exploring how different musical timbres are encoded in physiological signals under the supervision of Ben Zendel. I previously completed my BEng in Computer Science in Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in 2015 and also obtained a MSc in Information Studies.
