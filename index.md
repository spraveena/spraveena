### About

My interest primarily lies in the applicaiton of Machine learning or modelling techniques to understand how our brain perceives and processes music, and in the development of potential applications of music cognition. My current research revolves around using Machine Learning on EEG signals to understand how timbre is encoded and processed in our brains. 

I also am interested in potential uses of music cognition in rehabilitation.







### Research Background

I am currently a doctoral student in Memorial University of Newfoundland working on exploring how different musical timbres are encoded in physiological signals under the supervision of Ben Zendel at [CAANLab](https://caanlab.ca)

I completed my BEng in Computer Science in Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in 2015 where I explored using Machine Learning to detect ADHD on MRI scans, and my masters in Information Studies
